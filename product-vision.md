## Product Line

### BC Address Geocoder

The BC Address Geocoder provides address cleaning, correction, completion, geocoding, and reverse geocoding for government and the public at large. Geocoding turns a physical address into a form of spatial data called a point that can be used to display the location of the address on a map or answer spatial queries such as:

- how close is the nearest school, firehall, hospital, or swimming pool?
- are there any medical lab test facilities within three kilometres of here

Reverse geocoding finds the nearest address to a given point. Address cleaning and standardization allow you to deduplicate your data and link data records that have no key fields in common.

Established in 2013, the BC Address Geocoder is used by over two dozen government ministries and agencies in dozens of government digital services. As of June, 2020, the geocoder has processed over one billion addresses.

Major clients include Elections BC, MOTI, MoH Health Ideas Warehouse, SDPR, LTSA, AVED Business Intelligence Warehouse, BC Centre for Disease Control, BC Oil and Gas Commission, MCFD, FLNROD, most BC Health Authorities, City of Vancouver, BC Wildfire Service, BC Emergency Health Services, WildSafe BC.

The BC Address Geocoder is registered with the BC Data Catalogue, uses the DataBC API Gateway, and uses industry standards for its design and specification (e.g., REST, OpenAPI 3.0) which makes it easy to integrate into your application or API.

The BC Address Geocoder is based on authoritative address data provided by BC municipalities and BC Assessment. It also uses the BC Integrated Road Network which is the authoritative source for road network data in BC. In two independent studies, the BC Geocoder was found to be more accurate than commercial products.

The BC Address Geocoder is free and open to end-users. Geocoder addresses are covered under an open government license and their locations can be used for any legal purpose. For example, the Geocoder has become quite popular in the real-estate sector. Source code for the geocoder is in the process of being released under an Apache 2.0 license with the intent of building community to share enhancement and maintenance costs, ideas, documentation, and advocacy.

### BC Route Planner

Road and ferry travel are essential to the business of government. Route planning can be used to find the best routes, determine proximity of clients to service delivery locations, and optimize goods and service delivery.  Route planning is useful across a wide range of government business activities; from field operations to resource and emergency planning, to policy and law making.

Established in 2017, the BC Route Planner is recognized as a common component suitable for use across government. It is currently used by several government clients including the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Citizen Services, BC Emergency Health Services, and TransLink.

The BC Route Planner is registered with the BC Data Catalogue, uses the DataBC API Gateway, and supports industry standards in its design and specification including REST and OpenAPI 3.0. This makes it easy for developers to use our services in their digital services.

All source code for the BC Route Planner is available on github and released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. The BC Route Planner leverages other open source projects such as JSprit and Apache Spring.
