#### Q: How do I get postal code included with my geocoded address?

The Geocoder does not use or provide postal codes as they are not part of a physical address.

#### Q: Does the Geocoder use postal code to determine an address location?

The Geocoder does not use postal codes to determine address location. Address location is determined by looking up the input address, down to the civic number, in the set of known addresses in the Geocoder’s reference dataset. If no civic number match is found, the road network is searched for the block face containing the input address and a location is interpolated along the matching block face.
