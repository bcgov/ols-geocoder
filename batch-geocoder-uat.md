# Batch Geocoder User Acceptance Test Plan
If you are a current batch geocoder client and we have asked you to participate in the testing of a new release, this document describes what's involved so you effectively plan and execute acceptance testing.


|Test Name|Description|
| -------- | ----|
|Data Integration Test|Confirm that the new geocoder works with your existing batch scripts or an updated version of the [batch address list submitter](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-devkit/tree/gh-pages/als) if you are using it in your workflow.
|Data Volume Test|Confirm that the new geocoder can handle your current address lists.
|Address Match Accuracy Test|Measure improvement in match accuracy of new geocoder over the current geocoder. Address match accuracy is defined as the number of addresses with a score of 90 or higher divided by the total number of addresses in your list. We have created a python script called [batch_address_list_metrics](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-devkit/tree/gh-pages/alm) which takes your batch geocoder job results file (in CSV format) and computes the match accuracy of your address list and several other metrics. Operating instructions are included in the script. For more information of the match scoring process, see [Understanding Address Match Scoring](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-geocoder/blob/gh-pages/understanding-match-scoring.md) .
|Parser Validation test|Confirm parser changes are working as expected. We will provide a [test case file](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-geocoder/blob/gh-pages/atp_addresses.csv) containing addresses and expected results that you can submit to the batch geocoder and analyse to better understand the behavior of the new parser. We will run all parser validation tests before asking you to start your testing.
|Bash test|Use the [Location Services in Action application in our Test environment](https://bcgov.github.io/ols-devkit/ols-demo/index.html?gc=tst) to interactively enter addresses to better understand the geocoder accuracy improvements. The application will not only display the best match, it will display the top five matches. Also, by clicking on the pushpin of the address on the map, you can see the details of the top match including score, matchPrecision, and faults.
