# BC Batch Geocoder User Registration Process 

If you have a BC IDIR account, you don't need to register to access the Batch Geocoder. Just visit:

   https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/cpf/secure/ws/apps/geocoder/

If you don't have a BC IDIR account and are in an agency outside of core goverment (e.g., crown corporation, local or federal government, local health authority, university), here are the steps to registration and access:

1. Provide us (e.g., IDDDBCLS@Victoria1.gov.bc.ca) with answers to the following questions:

     - What is the nature of your business?
     - How do you propose to use the geocoder?
     - What business outcomes do you hope the geocoder will help you achieve? 
 
2. If you don't have an active bceid account, please register for a basic BCeID account at https://www.bceid.ca/

3.	Using your bceid account, try to log in to the batch geocoder located at https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/cpf/secure/ws/apps/geocoder/
You will be rejected but donâ€™t take it hard. Just email your bceid account name to us and we will complete the registration process and notify you when your registered.
