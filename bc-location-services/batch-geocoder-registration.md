# BC Batch Geocoder User Registration Process 

If you have a BC IDIR account, you don't need to register to access the Batch Geocoder. Just visit:

   https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/cpf/secure/ws/apps/geocoder/

If you don't have a BC IDIR account and are in an agency outside of core goverment (e.g., crown corporation, local or federal government, local health authority, university), here are the steps to registration and access:

1. Request access by opening a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/7/create/15) 
 
2. If you don't have an active BCeID account, please register for a *basic BCeID* account at https://www.bceid.ca/

3.	Using your BCeID account, try to log in to the batch geocoder located at https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/cpf/secure/ws/apps/geocoder/.
You will be rejected but donâ€™t take it hard. This process registers your account with the system. 

4. Add a comment to your existing ticket containing your BCeID account name. We will then grant your account with access to the batch geocoder.

Whether you are a BC IDIR user or a BCeID user, you need to learn how to prepare your address list for batch geocoding, submit your list to the batch geocoder, and understand geocoder output. Here are some links to get you started:
