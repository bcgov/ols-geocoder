# Glossary of Geocoder Terms
Term | Definition
----: | -----------
<a name="accessNotes">accessNotes</a> | Contains additional information that is helpful in determining the access location and any restrictions on mode of access (e.g., boat only, floatplane only). For example, turn by turn directions from a named road to a site in the woods could be helpful as in the following: From Tlell, travel north on Highway 16 till you see a big golden spruce tree on your left, hike west for about one kilometre.
<a name="accessPoint">accessPoint</a> | A point that lies on the curb or road edge of the site's assigned street and in the middle of a siteâ€™s driveway or access lane. If a site has no driveway or access lane, the accessPoint will be located in the middle of the entrance walkway.
<a name="accessPointRetireDate">accessPointRetireDate</a> | The date the access point was retired.
<a name="accessPointStatus">accessPointStatus</a> | The status of the access point (active, or retired). A civic access point is usually only Retired if the associated site is renumbered, destroyed, or combined with another site. A non-civic access point is usually retired when its associated site is assigned a civic number or the site becomes unoccupied.
<a name="adaptiveAddressInterpolation">adaptive address interpolation</a> | The process of inferring the location of a site with a given [civic number](#civicNumber) using a road centreline, an address range, and other known site locations for a given block face. Adaptive interpolation uses the ratio (civicNumber - precedingKnownCivicNumber) / (followingKnownCivicNumber - precedingKnownCivicNumber) and the locations of the preceding, known civic number and the following, known civic number.
<a name="addressListMatchAccuracy">address list match accuracy</a> | A measure of the match accuracy of a list of geocoded addresses. Address List Match Accuracy = number of addresses with a score of ninety or higher divided by the number of addresses in your address list. See also [Match Accuracy](#matchAccuracy)
<a name="addressMatch">address match</a> | Conveys site address match quality through [score](#score), [precision](#matchPrecision), and [faults](#faults) properties. [faults](#faults) is a data type that defines a list of faults. Each fault contains the nature of the fault, the address property affected, and the fault penalty. precisionPoints defines the points assigned to each match precision level. [MatchPrecision](#matchPrecision) is an enumeration of all precision levels. [MatchFaultPenalty](#matchFaultPenalty) defines the penalty value of each possible fault. Penalties are subtracted from the appropriate precision level points to arrive at a [score](#score).
<a name="addressString">addressString</a> | [Civic address](#civicAddress) or [intersection address](#intersectionAddress) as a single string in [Single-line Address Format](https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs/blob/master/geocoder/singleLineAddressFormat.md).

<a name="bianym">bianym</a> | A locality name or partial address that designates two or more localities or sites in a single jurisdiction. For example, Mill Bay is a bianym because it designates two populated places in BC: one located on the west side of Saanich Inlet and another located on the north side of Nass Bay. Another example is 120 Main St which designates sites in Ahousaht, Brittania Beach, Laxgalts\'ap Vancouver, and Salt Spring Island. 
<a name="blockID">blockID</a> | The unique, immutable identifier of a road segment in the Integrated Transportation Network that a matched address is located on.

<a name="streetName">streetName</a> | The official name of the street recognized by a municipality (e.g., Douglas in 1175 Douglas Street). Sometimes, its difficult to determine if a directional is part of a street name or not. For example, given the address 1640 East Kent Ave S, Vancouver, BC, is East part of the street name or a streetDirection? Given there is already a street Direction of "S" after the street type, East is likely part of the street name. A trickier example is North Park St. Is the word "North" a street direction or a part of the street name. Because it is not abbreviated, "North" is probably part of the street name. The street name in N Park St could be either Park or North Park.
