# Comparative Geocoder Address Match Accuracy Study

April 4, 2018

# Introduction

This study was conducted to determine the address match accuracy of four popular geocoders relative to the BC Address Geocoder. The geocoders under study include:
1. Bing Maps
2. ESRI
3. Google Maps 
4. Here

## Results Summary
Sixty civic addresses were chosen at random from the BC Address Geocoder; thirty in rural areas and thirty in urban areas. These addresses were fed into each of the four geocoders and results were tabulated and classified by match completeness (see Tables 1 and 2). 
Overall, all geocoders tested are suitable for use in urban areas and none are suitable for use in rural areas.
All geocoders did very well in urban areas. Bing and ESRI both achieved 100% full match accuracy. Google Maps and Here both achieved 97% full match accuracy.
All geocoders did very poorly in rural areas. Google achieved 10% full match accuracy, Bing and ESRI 3%, and Here 0%.

## Table 1: Urban address matches by Issue
|Name|No match|No street|No civic number|Wrong civic number|Full match|Wrong street|Wrong locality|No locality
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Bing Maps|||||30 (100%)|			
ESRI Geocoder|||||30 (100%)|			
Google Maps Geocoder|||||29 (97%)||1 (3%)	
Here Geocoder|||||29 (97%)||1 (3%)	

## Table 2: Rural address matches by Issue
|Name|No match|No street|No civic number|Wrong civic number|Full match|Wrong street|Wrong locality|No locality
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Bing Maps|16 (53%)|16 (53%)|26 (87%)|2 (7%)|1 (3%)|2 (7%)|5 (17%)|16 (53%)
ESRI Geocoder|1 (3%)|9 (30%)|22 (73%)|0|1 (3%)|4(13%)|14 (47%)|1 (3%)
Google Maps Geocoder|3 (10%)|3 (10%)|19 (63%)|1 (3%)|3 (10%)|8 (27%)|15 (50%)|3 (10%)
Here Geocoder|2 (7%)|3 (10%)|19 (63%)|1 (3%)|0|11 (37%)|26 (87%)|	2 (7%)

# Methodology

The set of random addresses generated in the BC StreetMap Comparison were used in this study. For completeness, the following defines how to generate new sets of random addresses suitable for this comparison.
 
## Creating sets of random urban and rural addresses

The Location Services in Action (LSIA) application was used to generate sample addresses and to analyse all street maps. The app runs in any HTML5-compatible browser and is located at:
https://ols-demo.apps.gov.bc.ca/index.html

Two sets of samples of the BC Address Geocoder civic addresses were taken:
1.	Thirty urban street addresses
2.	Thirty rural street addresses

### How to create urban street address samples

1.	Select thirty urban localities at random.
2.	For each urban locality, repeat steps 3 to 6.
3.	Enter locality into address tab of Location Services demo app then click search icon. 
4.	Zoom out until full extent of urban core is visible.
5.	Click Jump at Random icon and system will select and display a civic address chosen randomly from current map extent.
6.	Record civic address in an urban addresses spreadsheet.

### How to create rural street address samples

1.	Zoom map to full provincial extent
2.	In address tab, click Jump at Random icon. The system will select and display a civic address chosen randomly from the current map extent.
3.	Record civic address in a rural addresses spreadsheet.
4.	Repeat steps 1 to 4 until 30 civic addresses have been found.

### How to evaluate geocoder results

1.	Open an HTML5 compatible web browser.
1.	Open each geocoder in a separate tab. 
    1.	Bing Maps is located at https://www.bing.com/maps
    1.	ESRI geocoder is located at https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=b8ea19982bd74db3bd968d3c7f038e43
    1.	Google Maps is located at https://www.google.ca/maps
    1.	Here is located at: https://wego.here.com
    1.	The BC Geocoder is not being evaluated but can be used for QA purposes and can be found in the Location Services in Action application located at: https://ols-demo.apps.gov.bc.ca/index.html
1.	For each sample civic address and for each geocoder, do the following:
    1.	Select the tab of the appropriate geocoder (e.g., Bing ESRI, Google, Here).
    1.	Geocode the civic address and assess the quality of the response using the following criteria:
        1.	No match - no address returned; no match also means no street, civic number, etc
        1.	No street - no address returned or address returned had no street
        1.	No civic number - no address returned or address returned had no civic number
        1.	Wrong civic number
        1.	Full match
        1.	Wrong street 
        1.	Wrong locality
        1.	No locality - no address returned or address returned had no locality
    
    1. Ignore any additional administration areas such as regional district or community.
